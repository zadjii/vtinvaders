# vtinvaders - Space Invaders (on your terminal)

A rudimentary implementation of space invaders that lets you play in your terminal window!
Note: your terminal must support ANSI/VT100 escape sequences (sorry cmd.exe)


=========================

So, after a whole lot of investigation, I'm abandoning this project. I really
wanted to get more real-time input processing, something like
```
is_key_pressed('w')
```
But I couldn't seem to find a way to do that. So unless I can find a way to
do that (preferably without a full game engine), this project is gonna remain
abandoned.
